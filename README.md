# Coin Trends
Coin Trends is showcase or blueprint Android project that is trying to leverage what MVVP architecture does in a more effective way using latest frameworks and technologies available. 

Next are used:

- Retrofit2
- Dagger2 
- androidx
- Room Database
- Kotlin coroutines

Before going deeper how everything works I would like to explain what Coin Trends app does. 'Coin' in the name is not for nothing because applicaiton gets information about all the coins that
are on trade at Wavesplatform DEX (decentralized exchange). This DEX is chosen because REST API endpoints are free and there is no limit on access. If you want to create similar application that
works with different exchanges, you can achieve that relatively simply by changing exhange's specifics in Model layer. Since all data are static (in this version), room database is used 
for storing them for later use.
