# Coin Trends
Coin Trends is showcase or blueprint Android project that is trying to leverage what MVVP architecture does in a more effective way using latest frameworks and technologies available. 

Next are used:

- Retrofit2
- Dagger2 
- androidx
- Room Database
- Kotlin coroutines

Before going deeper how everything works I would like to explain what Coin Trends app does. 'Coin' in the name is not for nothing because application gets information about all coins that
are on trade at Wavesplatform's DEX (decentralized exchange). This exchange is chosen because they provide free REST API endpoints with no limits on usage. If you want to create similar 
application that works with other exchange(s), you can achieve that relatively simply by changing exchange's specifics in the model layer. Since all data are static (at least in current version), 
room database is used for storing them for later use.
